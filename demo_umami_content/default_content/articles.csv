Give it a go and grow your own herbs,"There&rsquo;s nothing like having your own supply of fresh herbs, readily available and close at hand to use whilst cooking. Whether you have a large allotment or a small kitchen window sill, there’s always enough room for something home grown.

<h2>Outdoors</h2>

<h3>Mint</h3>

Mint is a great plant to grow as its hardy and can grow in almost any soil. Mint can go totally wild though, so keep it contained in a pot or it might spread and take over your whole garden or allotment.

<h3>Sage</h3>

Like mint, sage is another prolific growing plant and will take over your garden if you let it. Highly aromatic, the sage plant can be planted in a pot or flower bed in well drained soil. The best way to store the herb is to sun dry the leaves and store in a cool, dark cupboard in a sealed container.

<h3>Rosemary</h3>

Rosemary plants grow into lovely shrubs. Easily grown from cuttings, rosemary plants do not like freezing temperatures so keep pots or planted bushes near the home to shelter them from the cold. It grows well in pots as it likes dry soil, but can survive well in the ground too. If pruning rosemary to encourage it into a better shape, save the branches and hang them upside down to preserve the flavour and use in food.&nbsp;

<h2>Indoors</h2>

<h3>Basil</h3>

Perfect in sunny spot on a kitchen window sill. Basil is an annual plant, so will die off in the autumn, so it’s a good idea to harvest it in the summer if you have an abundance and dry it. Picked basil stays fresh longer if it is placed in water (like fresh flowers). A great way to store basil is to make it into pesto!

<h3>Chives</h3>

A versatile herb, chives can grow well indoors. Ensure the plant is watered well, and gets plenty of light. Remember to regularly trim the chives. This prevents the flowers from developing and encourages new growth.

<h3>Coriander (Cilantro)</h3>

Coriander can grow indoors, but unlike the other herbs, it doesn't like full sun in the middle of the day. If you have a south facing kitchen window, this isn't the place for it. Although not as thirsty as basil, coriander doesn't like dry soil so don’t forget to water it! Cut coriander is best stored in the fridge.",Holly Foat,articles/give-it-a-go-and-grow-your-own-herbs,home-grown-herbs-1b.jpg,"Grow your own,Seasonal,Herbs"
The real deal for supermarket savvy shopping,"This may not surprise you - but your supermarket is a hot bed of marketing mayhem, designed to improve their profit and to encourage the consumer to spend more than they intended. The tricks that all supermarkets employ are sometimes sensible ploys that any retailer should do to improve sales - but some may be more subtle and less obvious than you might think.

With consumer awareness articles and documentaries frequently picking up on this topic, it&rsuoq;s likely the case that retailers find it harder to get away with the more obvious ploys. We are becoming ever more savvy consumers and there&rsuoq;s probably not a great deal that gets past us. But here&rsuoq;s a few retail tricks to keep in mind when you are rushing around the weekly supermarket stock-up.

<h2>Lost essentials</h2>

The layout of your supermarket may make sense to you when you have shopped there for a while, but for newcomers, trying to find essentials, it may make very little sense at all. Some supermarkets have noted that people come to their store to buy milk, bread or eggs and that by hiding these essentials in the far reaches of the store, they encourage the newcomer to wander the aisles - picking up other items as they go.

Sure, this can be great for nudging the memory on essentials you might otherwise forget, but for saving the pennies it&rsquo;s tough to stick to grabbing only the things you came for and the supermarkets know it!

<blockquote>
Our tip: Make your shopping list before leaving the house, checking what you need and sticking to that list. You could be amazed by what you&rsquo;ll save over time.
</blockquote>

<h2>Nonsensical multibuys</h2>

Buy one, get one free; two for £2 and meal deals. They all seem like a great deal. But in some cases these are loss leaders that are positioned to encourage you to take up the deal and buy other stuff while you are there. In other cases, deals for multi-buy or discounts on specific pack sizes might seem like a bargain, until you compare the pricing like-for-like on similar brands or with pack sizes for the same brand. These deals can mean you end up paying less but is it less for something you don&rsquo;t really need and in some cases you can end up paying more for the item. Remember, the supermarkets know you are often in a hurry and might not have the time to take in the full picture.

<blockquote>
Our tip: Don&rsquo;t be rushed, take the time to read the small print. The large print will draw you in but if you read the label small print, you should find the price per 100 grams or per litre and you&rsquo;ll be surprised how often the headline deals are actually more expensive than just buying a different package type or size of the product.
</blockquote>

<h2>Understanding our shopping habits</h2>

The cheapest products in a supermarket are almost always positioned on the bottom of the shelving where you&rsquo;ll need to bend over to pick it up. You also may not be able to easily read the price ticket. Most people will shop on the middle rows because it is easier and often quicker. These are where the highest profit items are kept and they are the ones the supermarkets want you to buy.

The layout, the music, the colours and the product types are all decided based on principles laid down by industry experts on people - psychologists and behavioural experts who know how we think. And so the savvy shopper will certainly be able to take advantage of great deals in their weekly shop, but it takes a little time and effort just to be more aware of what we are being encouraged to reach for in the aisles.",Megan Collins Quinlan,articles/the-real-deal-for-supermarket-savvy-shopping,cauliflower-placeholder-2.jpg,
The umami guide to our favourite mushrooms,"I think mushrooms are an incredible ingredient to cook with. My family are a mix of meat eaters and vegetarians and that can make meal times a bit of a challenge. But thanks to their variety, mushrooms can add deep flavours and a meaty texture to any dish and I've lost count of the number of times that the marvellous mushroom has proven the perfect ingredient for keeping everyone happy around our dinner table.

Obviously I'm fortunate because thankfully everyone in our household loves mushrooms and they are certainly a food that seems to divide opinion. But love them or hate them, you have to admit that with names like the chanterelle, the gypsy, horn of plenty, hen of the woods, mushrooms really are intriguing.

So with this variety of great-tasting mushroom varieties available to try, it often strikes me as a great shame that when meeting people who do like mushrooms, they have never really experienced anything beyond the ubiquitous white mushroom. 

So let's do a run down of some of my favourite mushrooms that are thankfully getting easier to get hold of from local supermarkets and grocers. But if you do have trouble finding them, I encourage you to keep looking because with their distinctive flavours these mushrooms are insanely good in a huge range of dishes, from Chinese stir fries through to creative twists in the Sunday morning fry-up.

Try the lovely <strong>shiitake</strong>. Used in Asian cooking, these can be purchased dried and rehydrated for a strong, deep flavour. Or buy fresh and add to Asian soups and stir-fries. Not only does this mushroom have an intense flavour, it looks lovely too. The deep brown and smooth shapes will provide texture to your meal. In their dried form and rehydrated, these are the perfect addition for a deep and flavourful stock for a risotto.

The gorgeous sunny <strong>chanterelle</strong> with its yellow flesh has a fruity flavour - but it is worth mentioning that there are many lookalikes out there and care should be taken to ensure you're eating the right ones. These look great in an omelette or an asian soup to complement the yellow tones.

The brown <strong>morel</strong> offers a meaty and distinctive flavour and you'll probably love how extraordinary they look in a meal. The morel is a more popular mushroom during the spring, when their availability is high.

For delicacy try the <strong>enoki</strong> with its tiny white heads that grow in a bunch. These can even be eaten raw in salads. Finally, you can choose the popular <strong>oyster</strong> mushroom. They are named thus because they look nothing like a mushroom and resemble the innards of an oyster. But the sweet flavour is delicious.

Of course, all this talk of trying new types of mushroom might be tempting you towards a bit of woodland wild food gathering. But seriously, don't, please leave that to the experts but we do recommend foraging in supermarkets, delis and Asian supermarkets for these more interesting flavours of mushroom and see how they can transform your meals.",Megan Collins Quinlan,articles/the-umami-guide-to-our-favourite-mushrooms,placeholder-3.jpg,"Mushrooms,Vegetarian"
Let's hear it for carrots,"Let&rsuo;s hear it for the humble carrot! This sweet and healthy &lsquo;everyday&rsuo; veg packs it all in. Great flavour, fantastic colour, and if you&rsuo;re one for believing in old wive&rsuo;s tales, can even help you to see better in the dark.

Who doesn&rsuo;t love cooking with this super versatile root veg? We roast them, boil them, blend them into soups and grate them into salads. The humble carrot has to be one of our favourite veg choices and it&rsuo;s been grown for thousands of years. But back then you were more likely to find a purple, red, yellow or white carrot and not the orange one we are all so familiar with today.

<h2>So what happened? When did orange become the preferred colour?</h2>

It was the Dutch during the 17th century who cultivated and made popular the orange variety, most likely because of its brilliant colour and higher levels of beta carotene. And it has also been suggested that they were cultivated in tribute to William of Orange, who led the struggle during the Dutch battle for independence. 

For whatever reason, the orange variety has stuck but look out for the &lsquo;heritage&rsuo; varieties at farmers markets and independent grocers, their mix of purple, yellow, orange and white are especially appealing to cook with and look absolutely great served as a side dish.

<h2>Nutrition</h2>

Carrots are rich in beta carotene which your body converts into vitamin A. It&rsuo;s often tricky to know whether cooking vegetables will enhance or reduce their nutritious value and unfortunately there&rsuo;s no simple rule. But in the case of carrots, nutrition is enhanced by consuming them cooked. In fact, it only takes 100 grams of carrots to get more than your daily value of vitamin A.

<h2>Get them at their best</h2>

Young carrots, harvested when they are small have an especially sweet flavour and they are absolutely delicious. To cook them you can skip the peeling, give them a good wash and pop them in the steamer for just a few minutes. Carrots will taste the best when they are fresh, so make sure they are firm and bright in colour when buying.

<h2>And that thing about carrots helping you see more in the dark?</h2>

Of course it&rsuo;s a myth. The idea that carrots can improve your ability to see better at night was used During World War II by the U.K. Ministry of Food, as propaganda for being able to see better during the blackouts and as an explanation for pilot&rsuo;s ability to fight successfully at night. Despite all this misinformation, there is some truth in carrots being of benefit to your eyesight and that&rsuo;s down to the vitamin A which helps to maintain vision.

<h2>Transform those humble carrots into something extra delicious</h2>
