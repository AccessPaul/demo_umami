Give it a go and grow your own herbs,"There&rsquo;s nothing like having your own supply of fresh herbs, readily available and close at hand to use whilst cooking. Whether you have a large allotment or a small kitchen window sill, there’s always enough room for something home grown.

<h2>Outdoors</h2>

<h3>Mint</h3>

Mint is a great plant to grow as its hardy and can grow in almost any soil. Mint can go totally wild though, so keep it contained in a pot or it might spread and take over your whole garden or allotment.

<h3>Sage</h3>

Like mint, sage is another prolific growing plant and will take over your garden if you let it. Highly aromatic, the sage plant can be planted in a pot or flower bed in well drained soil. The best way to store the herb is to sun dry the leaves and store in a cool, dark cupboard in a sealed container.

<h3>Rosemary</h3>

Rosemary plants grow into lovely shrubs. Easily grown from cuttings, rosemary plants do not like freezing temperatures so keep pots or planted bushes near the home to shelter them from the cold. It grows well in pots as it likes dry soil, but can survive well in the ground too. If pruning rosemary to encourage it into a better shape, save the branches and hang them upside down to preserve the flavour and use in food.&nbsp;

<h2>Indoors</h2>

<h3>Basil</h3>

Perfect in sunny spot on a kitchen window sill. Basil is an annual plant, so will die off in the autumn, so it’s a good idea to harvest it in the summer if you have an abundance and dry it. Picked basil stays fresh longer if it is placed in water (like fresh flowers). A great way to store basil is to make it into pesto!

<h3>Chives</h3>

A versatile herb, chives can grow well indoors. Ensure the plant is watered well, and gets plenty of light. Remember to regularly trim the chives. This prevents the flowers from developing and encourages new growth.

<h3>Coriander (Cilantro)</h3>

Coriander can grow indoors, but unlike the other herbs, it doesn't like full sun in the middle of the day. If you have a south facing kitchen window, this isn't the place for it. Although not as thirsty as basil, coriander doesn't like dry soil so don’t forget to water it! Cut coriander is best stored in the fridge.",Holly Goat,articles/give-it-a-go-and-grow-your-own-herbs,home-grown-herbs-1b.jpg,
The real deal for supermarket savvy shopping,"This may not surprise you - but your supermarket is a hot bed of marketing mayhem, designed to improve their profit and to encourage the consumer to spend more than they intended. The tricks that all supermarkets employ are sometimes sensible ploys that any retailer should do to improve sales - but some may be more subtle and less obvious than you might think.

With consumer awareness articles and documentaries frequently picking up on this topic, it&rsuoq;s likely the case that retailers find it harder to get away with the more obvious ploys. We are becoming ever more savvy consumers and there&rsuoq;s probably not a great deal that gets past us. But here&rsuoq;s a few retail tricks to keep in mind when you are rushing around the weekly supermarket stock-up.

<h2>Lost essentials</h2>

The layout of your supermarket may make sense to you when you have shopped there for a while, but for newcomers, trying to find essentials, it may make very little sense at all. Some supermarkets have noted that people come to their store to buy milk, bread or eggs and that by hiding these essentials in the far reaches of the store, they encourage the newcomer to wander the aisles - picking up other items as they go.

Sure, this can be great for nudging the memory on essentials you might otherwise forget, but for saving the pennies it&rsquo;s tough to stick to grabbing only the things you came for and the supermarkets know it!

<blockquote>
Our tip: Make your shopping list before leaving the house, checking what you need and sticking to that list. You could be amazed by what you&rsquo;ll save over time.
</blockquote>

<h2>Nonsensical multibuys</h2>

Buy one, get one free; two for £2 and meal deals. They all seem like a great deal. But in some cases these are loss leaders that are positioned to encourage you to take up the deal and buy other stuff while you are there. In other cases, deals for multi-buy or discounts on specific pack sizes might seem like a bargain, until you compare the pricing like-for-like on similar brands or with pack sizes for the same brand. These deals can mean you end up paying less but is it less for something you don&rsquo;t really need and in some cases you can end up paying more for the item. Remember, the supermarkets know you are often in a hurry and might not have the time to take in the full picture.

<blockquote>
Our tip: Don&rsquo;t be rushed, take the time to read the small print. The large print will draw you in but if you read the label small print, you should find the price per 100 grams or per litre and you&rsquo;ll be surprised how often the headline deals are actually more expensive than just buying a different package type or size of the product.
</blockquote>

<h2>Understanding our shopping habits</h2>

The cheapest products in a supermarket are almost always positioned on the bottom of the shelving where you&rsquo;ll need to bend over to pick it up. You also may not be able to easily read the price ticket. Most people will shop on the middle rows because it is easier and often quicker. These are where the highest profit items are kept and they are the ones the supermarkets want you to buy.

The layout, the music, the colours and the product types are all decided based on principles laid down by industry experts on people - psychologists and behavioural experts who know how we think. And so the savvy shopper will certainly be able to take advantage of great deals in their weekly shop, but it takes a little time and effort just to be more aware of what we are being encouraged to reach for in the aisles.",Sheri Wetherell,articles/the-real-deal-for-supermarket-savvy-shopping,cauliflower-placeholder-2.jpg,
5 Things You Don't Know About Mushrooms - Plus 5 Recipes!,"We love our mushrooms. Here in Maine, there are many varieties that grow wild, and our farmers' markets are full of them right now. Many of these mushrooms have names that are just as interesting to say as they are to look at: Chicken of the Woods, Morel, Chanterelles. They sound beautiful and taste even better. Mushrooms add incredible depth to any dish, and it makes even a simple burger seem elegant.  
 
Mushrooms are more than just tasty bits. They are also packed with health. The Mushroom Council shares these 5 cool (we think really cool) things about mushrooms you probably don't know.  
 
1. Mushrooms are the produce aisle’s only natural source of vitamin D, which helps build strong bones. In addition, they also provide selenium, a mineral that helps the immune system function properly, and are a good source of energy providing B vitamins.
 
2. Mushroom production is earth friendly. Growing mushrooms requires less water and land relative to many other crops. For example, Phillips Mushrooms Farms, one of the nation’s largest mushroom producers, grows more than 45 million pounds annually on less than 50 acres.
 
3. Restaurants and school cafeterias are making burgers healthier by blending finely chopped mushrooms into the burgers, cutting sodium and fat without sacrificing flavor, thanks to mushrooms’ inherent umami. In fact, 15 percent of all K-12 public schools are serving “Blended Burgers” featuring an approximately 30/70 mushroom/meat ratio. This summer, 349 restaurants created their own Blended Burger in a “Blended Burger Project™” competition presented by the James Beard Foundation.
 
4. Mushrooms are neither vegetable or fruit, they are in their own kingdom: fungi. Mushrooms provide many of the nutritional qualities of produce, as well as attributes more commonly found in meat, beans and grains. Mushrooms are low in calories, fat-free, cholesterol-free, gluten-free, and very low in sodium.
 
5. U.S. growers shipped nearly 800 million pounds of fresh mushrooms in 2015, according to Mushroom Council data. The most popular varieties are White Button, Maitake, Oyster, Crimini, Shiitake, Beech, Portabella, and Enoki.","Amy Jeanroy
